## About me 
I'm a junior software tester searching for a opportunity to work with experienced Testers and Programmers.
Working with computers, solving problems, learning new technologies seems like everyday task. 
Now, I wish to exploit my research and analytical skills in software testing. 
Currently, I am studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.
I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience.
It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
